Approach used.

1. Trained two different models for two different targets ie 'pet category' and 'breed category'
2. Used the listing and the issue date to calculate the days and the hours.
3. Identifying the null values and fillinf it with constamt value.
4.Label encoding for categorical variable ie 'color type'.
5. Checked for the skewness of the continuous variables.
6.Days were right skewed so applied log transformation.
7. Feature selection and checking the correlation with the target variables.
8. Applied XGBoost classifier (multiclass) for both the target variables.
9.Evalution metrics - F1 score(weighted)
